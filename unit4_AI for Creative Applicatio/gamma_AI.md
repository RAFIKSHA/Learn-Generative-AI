## 🖥️ Pre-work

2. Open the **dashboard**.  
3. Go to **Create New AI → choose Generate / Paste / Import**.

## 🚀 Step 1: Generate First Draft Presentation

### Prompt A — Create the Seminar Deck
Paste this into Gamma → **Generate**:

```

Create a 12-card presentation titled "Boosting Tourism: Local Experience Marketplace & AI Concierge". Use a clear professional tone for a mixed audience (hoteliers, travel startups, local tourism boards, investors). Include speaker notes (50–70 words each). Provide suggested visuals for each card. Structure the deck as:

1. Title & subtitle
2. Why tourism needs urgent ideas (3 short bullet stats + pain points)
3. Problem: Current pain for hotels & travel agents
4. Opportunity: changing traveler preferences after pandemic
5. Solution overview (one-sentence tagline + 3 pillars)
6. Pillar 1: Local Experience Marketplace (how it works, example)
7. Pillar 2: AI Concierge & Demand Forecasting (features & benefits)
8. Pillar 3: Sustainable Certification + Partner Network (benefits for hotels & travelers)
9. Implementation roadmap (pilot → scale, timeline quarters)
10. Business model & revenue streams
11. Pilot case study (sample KPIs & sample budget)
12. Ask & Call to Action (partnerships, pilot sign-up form link, next steps)

Make slides visually modern and suggest 1–2 image types per slide (photo, map, icon, chart). Keep text concise: headlines + 3–5 bullets. Also create a one-paragraph executive summary. Output should be ready to refine in Gamma.

```

👉 **What you’ll see:** Gamma returns a draft 12-card deck.  
Choose **Clean Business** or **Travel** template for best results.  

---

## ✍️ Step 2: Refine Content with Prompts
Paste these one by one into Gamma’s **Edit AI** field:

- **Fix tone / shorten:**  
  `Make slide 2 shorter and stronger: replace 3 bullets with 2 punchy pain-statements and one statistic line.`  

- **Add speaker note:**  
  `Write a 60-word speaker note for slide 6 describing a real-world example: a local cooking tour platform that increased bookings 30% for partner hotels.`  

- **Generate KPI table:**  
  `Create a 3-row KPI table for the pilot: Metric, Baseline, Target (e.g., Bookings per month, Avg. room occupancy, Direct booking %).`  

- **Replace stock images:**  
  `Replace visuals with: 1) high-quality photo of local cooking class, 2) infographic of marketplace flow, 3) small world map showing pilot region.`  

💡 **Tip:** Use Gamma’s *cards editor* → split bullets into multiple cards for step-by-step reveal.  

---

## 📄 Step 3: Create Additional Assets

- **Handout / PDF One-Pager**  
```

Create a 1-page handout summarizing the idea: problem, solution, 3 benefits, pilot ask, and contact email. Keep it printable as A4.

```

- **Landing Page (Gamma Site)**  
```

Turn this presentation into a one-page landing site for pilot sign-ups. Include: hero with CTA button "Join Pilot", 3 feature blocks, testimonials stub, and sign-up form link (Google Forms). Make mobile-friendly.

```

- **Social Media Teaser**  
```

Write a 120-word LinkedIn post announcing the pilot and a 20-word alt text for the social image.

```

- **Press Email to Hotels**  
```

Write a short outreach email (subject + 3-paragraph body) to hotel managers inviting them to a 4-week pilot.

```

- **Quiz & Feedback Form**  
```

Create 6 multiple-choice + 2 open questions for peer feedback about this idea and deck. Include rating scale 1–5 for clarity, feasibility, visuals.
